# odinproject-webpage

Welcome!

This my take on The Odin Project's "Project: Landin Page"
I made no modification whatsoever. Made a simple copy of the template given. Didn't feel like I was ready to improvise nor modify.

I am satisfied with the result. Tried to make it as responsive as possible. Not sure it would fit on a smartphone screen though! Not there yet I suppose.

Anyway, here you'll find the result of my work.
